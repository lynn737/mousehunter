Mousehunter is a game that simulates the life of a barn owl raising its young. As the owl, you must feed five healthy mice to your family of three owlets. 
The main challenge of the game is avoiding the poisoned mice, which are visually indistinguishable from healthy ones except for their slow movement and 
lack of a response when your owl character approaches.
Use the return key to click through the introduction page, and use the arrow keys to control your owl character. The owl will automatically pick up the 
first mouse it touches. Deliver the mice to your nest in the window of the barn.
